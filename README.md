The main focus of this assignment was to create reusable React components, which would be reused across the different pages that the assignment consists of. We were to structure a website based on an existing design file. The design was not entirely perfect, and sizes, colors, etc., were not WCAG 2.1 compliant. Part of my work was to make design decisions to replicate the page as the "client" had requested. The pages were only meant to be displayed on large screens, and in this case, I did not need to make the site responsive. I will need to replace the static information with data fetched from a web API. I also needed to implement validation functionality on the forms using RegEx.

The changes I made to the design were aimed at achieving WCAG 2.1 compliance.

# WCAG 2.1
## Colors
Regarding colors, I chose not to add any additional colors but used the existing ones, opting for darker text instead of yellow in the menu and section names.

## Size
I based the sizes on those provided by the "client" in the design file but changed them from px to rem.

## Aria-labels
I added aria-labels in places where alt text was not an option.

# Other changes
I also added my own user-friendly improvements. These two changes are not part of the criteria for Pass (G) or Pass with distinction (VG) but are simply "nice to have."

## Book Unit
Instead of the "client" having to type which type of unit they want to rent, users can now select the unit from a list.

## Header
I also made the header sticky so that users do not have to scroll up and down.

## Images
I added images instead of placeholders to create a more lively page. The images come from Unsplash, Pexels, and Icon8.
